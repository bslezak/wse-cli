WseCli - A CLI for managing Wowza Streaming Engine&trade;
========================================

The WseCli library is a command line utility to control Wowza Streaming Engine&trade; through the REST API. I've created this quickly as a starting point that could be more fully extended. Wowza Media Systems&trade; has an existing library as of this writing: https://github.com/WowzaMediaSystems/wse-rest-library-php This project is unaffliated with Wowza Media Systems, LLC. My hope is this project could encourage them and others to build a better library!

## Disclaimer

Admittedly, this is hackish right now. I expect you'll look at some pieces of this and think "WTF no", and I also expect and hope that you'll channel that energy to jump in and improve things.
